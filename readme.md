# Bayesian image process: Denoising and Inpainting
This repository is created as a supplementary for the coming PyConTW 2019 that will be held at Academia Sinica, Taipei. The python scripts should be contained and self-explained along with the notebook `tutorial.ipynb`. However, contents are subject to change and will be constantly updated and added. 

If you found any glitch while running these scripts, please contact via <a href='mailto:yenhsun@gate.sinica.edu.tw'>`yenhsun@gate.sinica.edu.tw`</a> or <a href='mailto:yenhsun@phys.ncku.edu.tw'>`yenhsun@phys.ncku.edu.tw`</a>, much thanks!
